# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

Selecting an operating system (OS) depends on several factors, including my specific needs, technical proficiency, hardware requirements, and personal preferences.
Ultimately, the best operating system for me align with my specific needs, preferences, and the tasks i intend to perform on my computer.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

- Visual Studio Code website.
"Download for Windows" button to download the installer file (VSCodeSetup.exe)
- locate the VSCodeSetup.exe file in your Downloads folder or the location where i saved it.
-I ADDED additional tasks like creating a desktop icon or adding VSCode to the PATH environment variable.
-Clicked "Install" to begin the installation process.
Waited for the installer to complete the installation of Visual Studio Code on my system.
Launch VSCode:
Once the installation is finished, i ptroced to launch VSCode immediately by leaving the checkbox checked.
Clicked"Finish" to complete the installation and launch VSCode.
-Upon launching VSCode for the first time, I was prompted to install recommended extensions and configure.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
Git installation to my local machine
-Git website
-git --version (for verification purpose).
-git global fror account verification
    git config global user.name "antonynyambura"
    git config global user.email "nyamburaantony157@gmail.com"
mkdir my-project (to make a directory).
cd my project
git init (to intialize a repository)
git add . my-project  (adding to file)
git commit -m  "initial commit"
git remote add origin  (adding url from git hub)
git push

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

 python.org.
Download Python Installer:

1."Downloads"
Choose Python Version:
Download Installer:
Click on the download link to get the Python installer for your operating system. For Windows, it will be an executable file (.exe).
2. Run the Python Installer:
Run the Installer:
Locate the downloaded installer file (e.g., python-3.x.x.exe) and double-click to run it.
Install Python:
Windows:
Check the box that says "Add Python 3.2 to PATH".

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
To install pip, the Python package installer, you generally don't need to install it separately if you've installed Python from python.org.

To check if pip is Installed:
Open Command Prompt or Terminal:
and run " pip --version"

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
Go to the MySQL Community Downloads page.
Under "MySQL Community Server", click on the "Download" button for the appropriate version.
Select the "Windows" platform and download the installer (mysql-installer-community-*.*.*.*.msi).
Run the Installer:

Locate the downloaded .msi file and double-click to run it.
Follow the installation wizard:
Choose "Developer Default" setup type, which includes MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and other useful tools.
Proceed with the default configuration options unless you have specific requirements to change them.
Set a root password for MySQL (make sure to remember this password).
Complete the Installation:
Allow the installer to complete the installation process.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
